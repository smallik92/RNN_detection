# Training a RNN architecture for a detection task 

In this project, I am trying to analyze the task of sensory detection by training a RNN model with imposed biological constraints (Dale's principle). Specifically, I am training this network to discriminate between two inputs that are combinatorially encoded by afferent terminals.

This is a self curated project and largely a work in progress. Once I am satisfied with the training results, I will move on to analyzing the representations learnt and the dynamics of the RNN. Please check back for updates.
