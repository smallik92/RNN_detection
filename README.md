# Training a RNN architecture for a detection task 

In this project, I am trying to analyze the task of sensory detection through a data-driven modeling approach. Specifically, I am training a RNN architecture to discriminate between two inputs. This custom task is the fundamental essence of sensory detection. 

This is work in progress. Once I am satisfied with the training results, I will move on to analyze the representations learnt and the dynamics of the RNN. Please check back for updates.
